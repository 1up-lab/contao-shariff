**NOTE:** We don't provide email-sharing and the additional info-button with heise-link, because in our opinion it's not necessary this time. Maybe in the future! ;-)

##ATTENTION

To use the Social-Media-icons in frontend you have to integrate Font Awesome. Just include the CSS from the Bootstrap CDN `//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css` (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">`) to your layout. You also have to include jQuery.
