# Shariff â€“ Social media buttons with privacy

Contao CMS module and content element providing [Shariff] (https://github.com/heiseonline/shariff). For more information about Shariff, please refer to [heise online] (http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Shariff-Social-Media-Buttons-mit-Datenschutz-2467514.html).

## Features

Provides sharing links for:

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Google+
- WhatsApp
- Xing
- LinkedIn
- Pinterest

You can choose your preferred service in the backend module or in the content element.

**NOTE:** For the time being, hofff/contao-shariff does not support email sharing or the info button that links to the heise website. We do not think this is necessary at the moment, but might include it in the future.

## Options

- Choose a predefined sharing URL
- Add a predefined sharing text instead of page title
- Add referrer track to URL
- "Twitter via" integration
- Alignment: horizontal or vertical
- Color theme: standard or gray
- Display number of shares

**IMPORTANT:**

To use the social media icons in the frontend, you will need to integrate Font Awesome. Just add the CSS from the Bootstrap CDN `//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css` (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">`) to your layout. You also have to include jQuery.
